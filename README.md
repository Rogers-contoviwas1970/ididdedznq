Brooooo, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Screamboat and OMG, what a trip! 😂 Like, seriously—who came up with that plot? It’s like they threw a murder mystery and a comedy show in a blender and forgot to put the lid on 🤣 The boat was like... haunted but not? Can a boat even be haunted? I don’t think I even get it lmao. Might need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again if I can even handle the chaos a second time.

I’m still chuckling at that one scene where the ghost was trying to dance but kept tripping over stuff, like come on, Casper, get it together. 🙄 And don’t even get me started on the detective dude; his hat was doing more detective work than he was. How is this guy still employed? 

> Dude, remember Jen and Mike? They would absolutely lose it over this  ! They love this kinda weird stuff. We should totally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and hit them up for a   night. You know they’d bring all those snacks that you can never pronounce, like those French thingamajigs.

Anyway, the plot twist at the end was... kind of expected but also not?? Bro, the butler being the evil mastermind the whole time, classic! But then the butler ends up being a ghost from the 1800s and evaporates when his plan fails... what even was that? Who writes this stuff??

if ghost == friendly: print(Spooky dance party engaged!) # lol, idk why I even added this.

I'm still kinda reeling from it. But in a good way, mostly? Who knows. Maybe I just need sleep. Or more coffee. Or maybe the   just got stuck in my brain like a catchy but weird song. Anyway, if you wanna give crazy another whirl, screamboat is def your ticket. 😂
